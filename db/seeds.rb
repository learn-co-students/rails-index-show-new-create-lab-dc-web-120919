# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# 
# coupon1 = Coupon.new("code1","Macy's")
# coupon2 = Coupon.new("code2","Best Buy")
# coupon3 = Coupon.new("code3","Walmart")
